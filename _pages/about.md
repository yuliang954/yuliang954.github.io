I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Seoul National University, working with [Jong-Seong Kug](https://gsai.snu.ac.kr/snu__professor/국종성-2/). Previously, I was a Schmidt AI in Science Postdoctoral Fellow at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, where I worked with [Shang-Ping Xie](https://sxie.ucsd.edu) and [Ilkay Altintas](https://words.sdsc.edu/ilkay/). I received my Ph.D. in Atmospheric, Oceanic, and Climate Dynamics from Yale University in December 2022, under the supervision of [Alexey Fedorov](https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/alexey-fedorov/about) and [Mary-Louise Timmermanns](https://people.earth.yale.edu/profile/mary-louise-timmermans/about). 

My research interests center on climate dynamics and climate change, particularly in the tropics. I study a range of topics, including the El Niño-Southern Oscillation, Madden-Julian Oscillation, monsoons, tropical cyclones, and global warming. I also develop and apply AI/ML methods to advance climate prediction and understanding.

In April 2026, I will join Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou) as an Assistant Professor. I plan to recruit 1–2 Ph.D. students and 1–2 postdoctoral researchers. Please feel free to reach out if you are interested in joining the group.
